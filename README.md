What is this project ?
----------------------

This project is **NOT** the official SlicerSurfaceToolbox repository.

It is a fork of SlicerSurfaceToolbox sources hosted at https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerSurfaceToolbox.

It is used as staging area to maintain and test patches that will be contributed back to the
official repository.


What is the branch naming convention ?
--------------------------------------

Each branch is named following the pattern `slicersalt-YYYY-MM-DD-vY.Y.Z-SHA{N}`

where:

* `vX.Y.Z` is the version of the forked project
* `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date of the last official commit associated with the branch.
* `SHA{N}` are the first N characters of the last official commit associated with the branch.
